# PyJugex
Find a set of differentially expressed genes between two user defined volumes of interest based on JuBrain maps. The tool downloads expression values of user specified sets of genes from Allen Brain API. Then, it uses zscores to find which genes are expressed differentially between the user specified regions of interests. This tool is available as a Python package. It also has been integrated into the 3D atlas viewer, where the user can select two JuBrain regions, enlist desired set of genes either by using an autocomplete feature or uploading a csv file. After the analysis is finished, the tool displays the genes and their calculated p values. The user also has the option of downloading the gene names and their p values and the ROI coordinates used in the analysis.

## Getting Started
git clone https://github.com/haimasree/Jugex.git
### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
